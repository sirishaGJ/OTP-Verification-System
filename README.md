![hq720](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30dbbd3f-a419-4552-b193-5f5343dbc45f)
A simple yet powerful Python project to generate and verify One-Time Passwords (OTP) via email simulation.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ 6-digit secure OTP generation
- 📧 Simulated email OTP sending
- 🔁 Retry mechanism with access control
- 🧱 Modular and maintainable code
- 🛡️ Security logic fundamentals

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Random module (OTP generation)
- Console I/O (User interaction)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. System generates a 6-digit OTP
2. Simulates sending it to a user email
3. Prompts user to input OTP
4. Verifies input with 3 retry attempts

## 📂 File Structure

- `OTP_Generator_.ipynb`: 
- `ppt/`: Optional presentation file
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## 💡 Future Scope

- Integrate SMTP/Email APIs
- Time-limited OTPs
- GUI for better UX
